<img src="https://scrapyard.hackclub.com/elements/wordmark.svg" width="200" >

Scrapyard is a hackathon about making stupid inventions with others, and this project is a submission.

**Captain Trashbeard Stirs** "*Agh! Those darn cords have me tangled up in circles.*" Unfortunately, to her dismay, Captain Trashbeard fumbles around and manages to swap her keybind for `Sneak` to `Attack/Destroy`. "*Oo-ooops!*". 

## Crafting
Take a `tripwire hook` and combine in a stand with an `awkward potion`, to reveal a `Potion of Entanglement`. Drink this, and the Captain Trashbeard herself will somehow tangle herself up in your controls and wreak havoc.

## Installation
This project was created using **Java** and the **Fabric API**. It has both clientside and serverside code. Pre-requisites: Fabric Mod Loader: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

**Download Latest Release**: Drag `tangled-in-scrapyard.jar` into your `minecraft/mods` folder
