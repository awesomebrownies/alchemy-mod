# Scrappy Alchemy

## Setup

Brew together an `awkward potion` + `potato` to create:
`Potion of Unclear Intent`~ !

## Mechanics
Drinking the potion of Unclear Intent gives you the effect `Tinkering Trashbeard`!

*Captain Trashbeard Stirs* "Oh! Fancy seeing you there..."

Unfortunately, to the audience, Captain Trashbeard fumbles around and manages to swap their keybind for `Sneak` to `Attack/Destroy`. "Oo-ooops!".
