## Setup

Brew together an `awkward potion` + `potato` to create:
`Potion of Unclear Intent`~ !

### Installation
1. Download the .zip and extract it from the releases section.
2. Navigate to your minecraft mods folder, and drag in the .jar file
3. Ensure you have the fabric jar from here: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/

## Mechanics
Drinking the potion of Unclear Intent gives you the effect `Tinkering Trashbeard`!

*Captain Trashbeard Stirs* "Oh! Fancy seeing you there..."

Unfortunately, to the audience, Captain Trashbeard fumbles around and manages to swap their keybind for `Sneak` to `Attack/Destroy`. "Oo-ooops!".
